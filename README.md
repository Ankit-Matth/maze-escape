# Maze Escape

I developed a game where the objective is to guide a rat through a challenging, randomly generated maze to reach its food. By utilizing the p5.js library, I optimized the rendering of graphics, enhancing overall interactivity. To elevate the user experience, I incorporated audio/sound effects using p5.sound.js, aiming for both visual appeal and engagement. In addition, I utilized development tools such as ESLint, Prettier, and Husky to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices. This project showcases my proficiency in javascript, p5.js, Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), and familiarity with various development tools for robust web project development.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. p5.js and p5.sound.js
3. Dev Tools: ESLint, Prettier, Husky

I employed various built-in functions such as `setup(), draw(), keyPressed(), loadSound(), play(), stop(), etc.` provided by p5.js and p5.sound.js to develop this game and integrate audio into it. In the game, players have the task of guiding a rat to its food source using arrow keys or on-screen buttons. The game offers three difficulty levels - `"Easy," "Medium," and "Hard"` - giving players the choice of their preferred challenge level. To enhance the gaming experience, two buttons, **"Hint"** (providing guidance on the path from the rat to the food) and **"Solve"** (automatically guiding the rat through the maze to reach the food), introduce interactive elements and strategic options for players to explore and enjoy.
